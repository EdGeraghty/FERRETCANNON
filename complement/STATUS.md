# Complement Integration Status

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE AND RUNNING**

Big shoutout to the FERRETCANNON massive for making this happen! ðŸŽ†

## Current Test Status

**Latest Run**: Tests are successfully executing against FERRETCANNON! ðŸŽ‰

The Complement integration is fully operational:
- âœ… Docker image builds successfully
- âœ… Server starts and accepts connections
- âœ… Complement can communicate with FERRETCANNON
- âœ… Tests execute and provide detailed results
- âœ… CI workflow runs automatically on pushes/PRs

As expected for an actively developed homeserver, some tests currently fail - this is normal and provides a roadmap for continued spec compliance improvements. The integration is working correctly and providing valuable feedback on implementation gaps.

## Overview

FERRETCANNON now has full integration with **Complement**, the official Matrix compliance test suite used by Synapse, Dendrite, Conduit, and other Matrix implementations to validate adherence to the Matrix Specification v1.16.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Complement Docker Image (`Complement.Dockerfile`)

A specially crafted Dockerfile that:
- âœ… Builds FERRETCANNON in a multi-stage build
- âœ… Exposes port 8008 (Complement standard)
- âœ… Includes health checks for server readiness
- âœ… Dynamically configures server name via environment variables
- âœ… Uses SQLite database for test isolation
- âœ… Includes all dependencies needed for testing

**Key Features:**
- Multi-stage build for optimal image size
- Environment variable substitution for dynamic configuration
- Health check on `/_matrix/client/versions` endpoint
- Proper entrypoint script for container initialization

### 2. Helper Script (`complement/run-complement.sh`)

A comprehensive bash script that automates the entire testing process:
- âœ… Prerequisite checking (Docker, Go)
- âœ… Automatic image building
- âœ… Complement repository cloning/updating
- âœ… Test execution with configurable options
- âœ… Colourful output with test results
- âœ… Support for running specific test patterns

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Run all tests
./run-complement.sh

# Run specific tests
./run-complement.sh -t TestRegistration

# Skip rebuild (faster iteration)
./run-complement.sh -n -N

# Custom timeout
./run-complement.sh -T 1h
```

### 3. Documentation

- âœ… What Complement is and why it matters
- âœ… Prerequisites and setup instructions
- âœ… Configuration options
- âœ… Understanding test results
- âœ… Troubleshooting common issues
- âœ… CI/CD integration examples

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/complement.yml`)

Automated CI/CD integration that:
- âœ… Runs on push to main/develop branches
- âœ… Runs on pull requests
- âœ… Can be triggered manually
- âœ… Builds Complement Docker image
- âœ… Runs full test suite
- âœ… Parses and displays results
- âœ… Uploads test artifacts
- âœ… Fails the build if tests fail

**Benefits:**
- Automatic testing on every commit
- Visible test results in PR checks
- Test output available as downloadable artifacts
- Prevents merging code that breaks compliance

### 5. Updated Main README

The main README now includes:
- âœ… Section on Complement integration
- âœ… Links to Complement documentation
- âœ… Distinction between Complement and internal tests
- âœ… Quick start commands
- âœ… Explanation of what gets tested

### 6. .gitignore Updates

Added entries to prevent committing:
- âœ… `complement-checkout/` - The cloned Complement repository
- âœ… Test output and temporary files

## How to Use

### Local Testing

1. **Quick Start** (recommended):
   ```bash
   cd complement
   ./run-complement.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Setup** (for more control):
   ```bash
   # Build image
   docker build -t complement-ferretcannon -f Complement.Dockerfile .
   
   # Clone Complement
   git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/complement.git
   cd complement
   
   # Run tests
   COMPLEMENT_BASE_IMAGE=complement-ferretcannon:latest go test -v ./tests/...
   ```

### CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically on:
- Pushes to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

To manually trigger:
1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Complement Tests" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

## What Gets Tested

Complement runs hundreds of comprehensive tests across:

### Client-Server API
- âœ… User registration and authentication
- âœ… Login flows (password, token)
- âœ… Room creation and management
- âœ… Sending and receiving messages
- âœ… User profiles (display name, avatar)
- âœ… Device management
- âœ… Presence
- âœ… Typing notifications
- âœ… Read receipts and markers
- âœ… Push notifications
- âœ… Account data
- âœ… Content repository (upload/download)

### Server-Server API (Federation)
- âœ… Server discovery (well-known)
- âœ… Server key exchange
- âœ… Event signing and verification
- âœ… make_join/send_join flows
- âœ… make_leave/send_leave flows
- âœ… Invites across servers
- âœ… Event distribution
- âœ… Backfill
- âœ… State resolution
- âœ… Missing events handling
- âœ… Transaction processing

### Security & Cryptography
- âœ… Event content hashing
- âœ… Event signature verification
- âœ… Canonical JSON serialisation
- âœ… Server key rotation
- âœ… Device key upload
- âœ… One-time keys
- âœ… Key claiming

### Room Versions
- âœ… Room version support (v1-v12)
- âœ… State resolution algorithms
- âœ… Event format validation
- âœ… Auth rules enforcement

## Expected Results

### First Run

On the first run, some tests may fail. This is normal and expected for a homeserver implementation in active development. Common areas that might need work:

1. **Edge Cases** - Complement tests many edge cases that manual testing might miss
2. **Spec Compliance** - Some endpoints might have minor deviations from spec
3. **Federation Quirks** - Complex federation scenarios
4. **Room Version Specifics** - Differences between room version behaviours

### Iterative Improvement

The workflow is:
1. Run Complement tests
2. Identify failing tests
3. Fix issues in FERRETCANNON
4. Re-run tests
5. Repeat until all tests pass

### Success Criteria

A fully compliant Matrix homeserver should:
- âœ… Pass all mandatory Client-Server API tests
- âœ… Pass all mandatory Server-Server API tests
- âœ… Pass cryptography and security tests
- âœ… Support all active room versions

## Technical Details

### Docker Configuration

The `Complement.Dockerfile`:
- Uses Alpine Linux for small image size
- Two-stage build (build + runtime)
- Includes SQLite for database
- Installs `wget` for health checks
- Includes `envsubst` for config templating
- Exposes port 8008
- Health check interval: 5 seconds
- Health check timeout: 3 seconds
- Health check retries: 20

### Server Configuration

The entrypoint script generates a minimal config:
```yaml
server:
  serverName: ${SERVER_NAME}  # Dynamic
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8008

database:
  url: jdbc:sqlite:/data/ferretcannon.db
  driver: org.sqlite.JDBC

media:
  basePath: /data/media
  maxUploadSize: 52428800

development:
  enableDebugLogging: false
  isDebug: false
```

### Test Execution

Complement:
1. Starts a container from the image
2. Waits for health check to pass
3. Runs test suites against the server
4. Collects results
5. Stops and removes the container
6. Repeats for each test

## Next Steps

### Immediate (You or CI)

1. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   cd complement
   ./run-complement.sh
   ```

2. **Review results**: Check which tests pass and which fail

3. **Document baseline**: Record current pass rate

### Short Term

4. **Fix failing tests**: Address issues revealed by Complement
5. **Re-run tests**: Verify fixes work
6. **Iterate**: Continue fixing until high compliance rate

### Long Term

7. **Maintain compliance**: Run tests on every PR
8. **Track metrics**: Monitor pass rate over time
9. **Contribute back**: Report Complement issues if found
10. **Share results**: Document FERRETCANNON's compliance status
