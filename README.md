# FERRETCANNON

FERRETCANNON is a clean-room implementation of [The Matrix Specification](https://spec.matrix.org/)
in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)/[KTor](https://ktor.io). (#YOLO)

This will never be a full implementation, as the Matrix Spec is extremely metadata heavy - much of which can
get in the sea.

I am writing this purely as an excuse to learn [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I do not ever expect anyone to use it.

There's a high likelihood I'll get bored and move onto something else before it gets to the stage of being particularly
useful as an implementation.

## Installation

Run the JAR.
