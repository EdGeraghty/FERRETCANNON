2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: GitHub Actions (should be automatic)
3. Wait for the workflow to complete (check Actions tab)

### Step 3: Configure DNS

Choose one option:

#### Option A: CNAME (Recommended)
```
Type:  CNAME

### Step 4: Verify Custom Domain

1. Wait 5-60 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Check: https://github.com/EdGeraghty/FERRETCANNON/settings/pages
3. Custom domain should show: `areweyolosynapseyet.roflcopter.wtf`
4. DNS check should pass with green tick
5. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" (automatic after DNS propagates)

### Step 5: Test the Site

1. Visit: https://areweyolosynapseyet.roflcopter.wtf
2. Verify the dashboard loads
3. Check test results are displayed
4. Confirm auto-refresh works (wait 5 minutes)
5. Test on mobile device

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Once deployed, verify:

- [ ] Site loads at https://areweyolosynapseyet.roflcopter.wtf
- [ ] HTTPS certificate is valid (padlock icon)
- [ ] Overall compliance percentage displays correctly
- [ ] All 15 test suites are shown
- [ ] Colour coding works (green/yellow/red based on pass rate)
- [ ] Statistics show correct numbers (passed/failed/skipped/total)
- [ ] Links work (GitHub, workflow, spec)
- [ ] Footer shows last update time
- [ ] Page is responsive on mobile
- [ ] Auto-refresh works (check after 5 minutes)
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

## üîß Troubleshooting

### DNS not propagating
```bash
# Check DNS status
dig areweyolosynapseyet.roflcopter.wtf

# Or use online tool
# https://www.whatsmydns.net/
```

### Site shows 404
- Check GitHub Pages is enabled in settings
- Verify workflow completed successfully
- Check CNAME file contains correct domain
- Wait 5 minutes and try again

### HTTPS certificate error
- GitHub provisions certificates automatically
- Can take 10-60 minutes after DNS propagation
- Try removing and re-adding custom domain in settings

### Data not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `complement-badges` branch exists
- Verify `test-results.json` exists in that branch
- Check if workflow has run at least once

## üìä Monitoring

After deployment:

1. **Check Workflow Runs**: https://github.com/EdGeraghty/FERRETCANNON/actions/workflows/complement-parallel.yml
   - Verify workflow updates badge data regularly

2. **Monitor Dashboard**: https://areweyolosynapseyet.roflcopter.wtf
   - Check "Last updated" timestamp
   - Verify results match latest workflow run

3. **Test Suite Progress**: Track improvement over time
   - Current overall: ~18% pass rate
   - Target: Increase pass rate steadily
   - Focus on failing suites

## üéØ Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:

- ‚úÖ Site is accessible at https://areweyolosynapseyet.roflcopter.wtf
- ‚úÖ HTTPS works without warnings
- ‚úÖ Test results display correctly
- ‚úÖ Data updates after workflow runs
- ‚úÖ No errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive layout works

## üìù Post-Deployment

1. Announce the dashboard to the team
2. Share the URL: areweyolosynapseyet.roflcopter.wtf
