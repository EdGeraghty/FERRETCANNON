## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.
COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.
DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.
- Local testing has a working login as per `config.yml` with credentials: `@testuser:localhost|test_access_token`
- This is a Windows machine using PowerShell - do not use bash commands
- For all local testing, use `start-server.ps1 -NoPrompt` to start the server in background. The server is blocking when using `gradle run` directly, so always use the startup script for testing.
- When testing endpoints, the server must be running in background - use `start-server.ps1 -NoPrompt` for this purpose
<!--Added by Ed-->
- This is a Matrix Server. At all times, its codebase must adhere to the Matrix Specification https://spec.matrix.org/v1.15/
<!--/Added by Ed-->
FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.
EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.
PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.
TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project
Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.

- [x] Implement User Profile Federation
	<!-- Complete User Profile Federation implementation according to Matrix Server-Server API v1.15 specification. Added /query/displayname and /query/avatar_url endpoints with proper authentication and error handling. Improved getUserProfile function to use Users table directly for efficient database queries, with fallback to room state events. All endpoints include proper Matrix authentication, validation, and Matrix-compliant error handling. Project compiles successfully. -->
- [x] Implement Username Availability Checking
	<!-- GET /_matrix/client/v3/register/available endpoint implemented according to Matrix Client-Server API v1.15 specification. Added username format validation, availability checking using AuthUtils.isUsernameAvailable(), and proper Matrix error responses (M_INVALID_USERNAME, M_USER_IN_USE, M_MISSING_PARAM). Endpoint returns 200 for available usernames and appropriate error codes for invalid or taken usernames. Project compiles successfully. -->
- [x] Fix Server Name Configuration
	<!-- Systematically replaced all hardcoded "localhost" references with config.federation.serverName throughout the codebase. Updated AuthUtils.createUser() function to accept serverName parameter, fixed user ID generation in ClientRoutes.kt registration and OAuth endpoints, updated room ID generation, fixed third-party network endpoints, and updated MediaStorage.kt default userId to use generic example.com. All changes maintain Matrix specification compliance and project compiles successfully. -->
- [x] Implement Client-Server Device Key Query
	<!-- POST /_matrix/client/v3/keys/query endpoint implemented according to Matrix Client-Server API v1.15 specification. Added device key fields to Devices table (ed25519Key, curve25519Key, ed25519KeyId, curve25519KeyId), implemented generateDeviceKeys() and getDeviceKeysForUsers() functions in AuthUtils.kt, and added endpoint in ClientRoutes.kt with proper authentication, validation, and Matrix-compliant error handling. Device keys are now automatically generated for new devices and can be queried by Matrix clients for end-to-end encryption setup. Project compiles successfully. -->
- [x] Fix Push Rules Authentication 500 Error
	<!-- Fixed AttributeKey type consistency issue in authentication middleware that was causing 500 Internal Server Error for pushrules endpoint. Updated ClientRoutes.kt to use properly typed AttributeKey instances (AttributeKey<String>, AttributeKey<UserIdPrincipal>, AttributeKey<Boolean>) instead of untyped AttributeKey. Server now returns proper Matrix error codes (M_MISSING_TOKEN) instead of 500 errors. Project compiles successfully and authentication middleware works correctly. -->
- [x] Fix Capabilities Endpoint Authentication Error Handling
	<!-- Fixed validateAccessToken() helper function logic that was incorrectly returning M_MISSING_TOKEN for invalid tokens instead of M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN. Corrected the order of conditions in the when statement to prevent response overwriting. Invalid tokens now properly return M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN while missing tokens return M_MISSING_TOKEN. Server compiles successfully and authentication error handling works correctly for all endpoints. -->
- [x] Refactor FederationV1Routes.kt into Modular Components
	<!-- Successfully refactored the monolithic FederationV1Routes.kt file (2991 lines) into smaller, more manageable modules for improved maintainability, readability, and code organization. Created 10 separate module files: FederationV1Utils.kt (utility functions), FederationV1Events.kt (event endpoints), FederationV1State.kt (state endpoints), FederationV1Membership.kt (membership endpoints), FederationV1ThirdParty.kt (third-party endpoints), FederationV1PublicRooms.kt (public rooms), FederationV1Spaces.kt (spaces), FederationV1UserQuery.kt (user queries), FederationV1Devices.kt (device endpoints), FederationV1Media.kt (media endpoints), and FederationV1ServerKeys.kt (server keys). Cleaned up main FederationV1Routes.kt to only include module calls, reducing it from 2991 lines to 108 lines. Resolved all compilation errors including duplicate function definitions and missing imports. Project compiles successfully and federation endpoints work correctly. -->
