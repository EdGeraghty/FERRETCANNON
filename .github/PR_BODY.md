Branch: complement/homerunner-portbinding

Summary
-------
This draft branch was created to collect and push diagnostic changes relating to Complement / Homerunner port binding and local federation test failures.

What this branch contains
------------------------
- A diagnostic test log: `complement-TestGetMissingEventsGapFilling.txt` (captured test output from a Complement run). This log shows the homeserver starting and Complement attempting to fetch the server public key from the host via host.docker.internal on an ephemeral port (for example, `host.docker.internal:42739`), with repeated connection failures and timeouts.

What this branch does NOT contain
--------------------------------
- No persistent source-code changes to the main server codebase. Any small experimental edits previously performed were reverted on request; the repository should contain only diagnostic artifacts.

Context and reasoning
---------------------
- The attached log was captured while running Complement with HOMERUNNER_HS_PORTBINDING_IP=0.0.0.0 to help diagnose container -> host connectivity problems.
- Containers resolved `host.docker.internal` to the Docker host IP (e.g., `192.168.65.254`), but attempts to connect to the published ephemeral ports repeatedly failed, leading Complement to report inability to fetch public keys and resulting test failures.

Suggested reviewer actions
-------------------------
- Inspect `complement-TestGetMissingEventsGapFilling.txt` to confirm the exact failed host:port pairs (search for `host.docker.internal` in the log).
- If desired, run local host diagnostics to verify whether the host is listening on the ephemeral published ports and whether the Docker port publication is reachable from containers. Useful commands (PowerShell):
  - `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 42739` or `netstat -an | Select-String 42739`
  - `docker ps --format "{{.ID}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}"`
  - `docker port <container-id>`
  - In WSL: `curl -vk https://host.docker.internal:42739/_matrix/key/v2/server/ed25519:<keyid>`

Notes
-----
- The branch is a draft to keep the diagnostic artifact available without merging into `main`.
- If you want me to push only non-log changes next, I can re-run the commit steps and explicitly exclude large log files.
